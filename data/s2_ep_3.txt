h3: At Craster's Keep[]
p: Craster drags his captive Jon Snow back to his keep. He had caught Jon spying on him while he left a baby in the forest for the White Walkers and has beaten him bloody. Craster orders the men of the Night's Watch out of his home, blaming Jon. Lord Commander Jeor Mormont questions Jon about his actions. Jon realizes that Jeor has known all along that Craster is sacrificing his sons. However, Mormont considers Craster too valuable a contact to risk offending, as he is one of their few sources of information and shelter beyond the Wall. Mormont himself is disgusted by Craster's human sacrifices (not to mention his incestuous relationships with his own daughters), but he will not interfere, and forbids Jon from doing so, as Craster has helped many members of the Night's Watch, among them, Benjen Stark. Jon reveals seeing something take the child. Jeor predicts that whatever it was Jon will see it again.

h3: On the Iron Islands[]
p: Theon's baptism.
p: Theon Greyjoy is included in his father Balon's war council. Balon reveals his plan to attack the lightly defended North while their armies are fighting against House Lannister. Theon is fuming when he is assigned a single ship to raid the fishing villages of the Stony Shore while his sister Yara is put in command of thirty ships and told to take Deepwood Motte. Theon implores his father to reconsider, claiming that if the Greyjoys attack the North, they face the possibility of total destruction if they lose, but if they ally with the Starks and win, Balon will be crowned King of the Iron Islands and House Greyjoy will be awarded Casterly Rock and essentially the source of the Lannisters' wealth along with it, but Balon rebuffs Theon and chastises him for becoming loyal to the Starks. Theon challenges his father's lack of faith in him and reminds him that he gave him up as a ward. Balon reacts by hitting his son and storming out as Theon shouts at him from behind. Theon considers warning Robb about his father's actions, but ultimately reaffirms his loyalty to his family by being baptised by a Drowned Man.

p: Varys: "Power resides where men believe it resides. It's a trick, a shadow on the wall. And a very small man can cast a very large shadow."
p: [After a day of being tormented by Joffrey, Sansa Stark attends an awkward dinner with Cersei, and her younger children Myrcella and Tommen. Everyone eats wordlessly until Myrcella finally breaks the awkward silence]Princess Myrcella Baratheon: (to Cersei) "When will Joffrey and Sansa be married?"
Queen Cersei Lannister: "Soon darling, when the war is over."
Myrcella: (to Sansa) "Mother says I'll have a new gown for the ceremony, and another for the feast." (Quickly thinking of something nice to say to Sansa) "But yours will be ivory, since you're the bride."(Sansa sits in a stunned silence after being reminded that she will be forced to marry Joffrey)
Cersei: (to Sansa) "The princess just spoke to you."
Sansa Stark: (to Cersei) "Pardon, your grace." (to Myrcella) "I'm sure your dress will be beautiful, Myrcella. I'm counting the days until the fighting's done, and I can pledge my love to the king in sight of the Gods."
Prince Tommen Baratheon: (to Cersei) "Is Joffrey going to kill Sansa's brother?"
Cersei: "He might. Would you like that?"
Tommen: (pausing to weigh the question) "No...I don't think so."
Cersei: (smiling coldly at Sansa) "Even if he does, Sansa will do her duty. Won't you, little dove?"
p: [At Pyke, Balon Greyjoy looks over a map with Yara and Theon.]Lord Balon Greyjoy: "The wolf pup has gone south with the entirety of the northern army at his back. While he's tangling with the lion in the Westerlands, the North is ripe for the taking. The ironborn will reave and pillage as it was in the old days all along the northern coast. We'll spread out dominion across the green lands securing the Neck and everything above. Every stronghold will fall to us one by one."
p: Balon: "What are our words? Our words?"
p: Theon Greyjoy: "'We Do Not Sow.'"
Balon: "'We Do Not Sow.' We are Ironborn. We're not subjects, we're not slaves. We do not plow the fields or toil in the mines. We take what is ours. Your time with the wolves has made you weak."
Theon: "You act as if I volunteered to go. You gave me away if you remember. The day you bent the knee to Robert Baratheon. After he crushed you! Did you take what was yours then?" [Balon slaps Theon and strides away.] "You gave me away! Your boy! Your last boy! You gave me away like I was some dog you didn't want anymore! And now you curse me because I've come home!"
[Balon strides away while Yara approaches her brother.]
Yara Greyjoy: "You'd have our father bow down to your other family?"
Theon: "I have no other family!"
Yara : "Don't you?" [Yara turns to leave as well.] "Make your choice, Theon, and do it quickly! Our ships sail with or without you."
p: Cersei: "You monster! Myrcella is my only daughter. Do you really think I will let you sell her like a common whore!?"
p: Tyrion Lannister: "Myrcella is a princess! Some would say she was born for this!"
Cersei: "I will not let you ship her off to Dorne as I was shipped off to Robert Baratheon!"
Tyrion: "Dorne is the safest place for her."
Cersei: "Are you mad? The Martells loathe us!"
Tyrion: "That's why we need to seduce them. We're going to need their support in the war your son started!"
Cersei: "She'll be a hostage!"
Tyrion: "A guest."
Cersei: "You won't get away with this! You think the piece of paper father gave you keeps you safe? Ned Stark had a piece of paper too."
p: Tyrion: "You disappoint me, Grand Maester."
p: Pycelle: "I am your loyal servant."
Tyrion: "So loyal that you told the queen about my plans to send Myrcella to Dorne."
Pycelle: "No, never! It's a falsehood, I swear it! It wasn't me. Ah, Varys! It was Varys, the Spider..."
Tyrion: "See, I told Varys that I was giving the princess to the Greyjoys. I told Littlefinger that I planned to wed her to Robin Arryn. I told no one that I was offering her to the Dornish. No one but you."
p: Tyrion Lannister: "Cut off his manhood and feed it to the goats."
p: Timett: "There are no goats, halfman!"
Tyrion: "Well, make do!"
p: Tyrion: "How many Hands have you betrayed, Pycelle? Eddard Stark, Jon Arryn..."
p: Pycelle: "Lord Arryn! He knew, he knew the tr-truth abou-about the Queen and he planned to act, to tell King Robert!"
Tyrion: "So you poisoned him?"
Pycelle: "No! Never!"
Tyrion: "But you let him die! Made sure he succumbed!"
Pycelle: "Lannister, I've always served Lannister!"
Tyrion: "Get him out of my sight! Throw him in one of the black cells!"
